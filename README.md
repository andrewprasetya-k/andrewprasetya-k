## 👋 About Me

I’m **Andrew Prasetya**, a Computer Science student and Full-Stack Developer with a strong interest in building **reliable, maintainable, and production-oriented web applications**.

My work mainly focuses on **application-level engineering**: backend APIs, real-time systems, authentication flows, database design, and frontend integration. I care about clean architecture, clear abstractions, and writing code that can scale with real users.

Alongside my studies, I’ve gained hands-on experience through internships, teaching assistant roles, and personal projects, which shaped how I approach software as a professional craft—not just an academic exercise.
