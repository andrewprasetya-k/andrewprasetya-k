## üöÄ Quick Start Customization

### Step 1: Basic Information

Replace these placeholders in the header section:

```markdown
text=YOUR%20NAME%20HERE  ‚Üí  text=John%20Doe
desc=Your%20Tagline%20Here  ‚Üí  desc=Full%20Stack%20Developer
```

**Note:** Use `%20` for spaces in URLs!

### Step 2: Update Username

Find and replace all instances of `andrewprasetya-k` with your actual GitHub username throughout the README.

You can do this with a text editor's find-and-replace feature:
- Find: `andrewprasetya-k`
- Replace: `your-github-username`

### Step 3: Fill in About Me Section

Update the YAML block with your information:

```yaml
name: "Your Full Name"
location: "City, Country"
current_role: "Your Current Role/Title"
company: "Your Company/Organization"
interests:
  - Interest 1
  - Interest 2
  - Interest 3
experience: "X years in software development"
```

Replace the bullet points below it with your actual information.

### Step 4: Customize Tech Stack

Edit the tech stack badges to match the technologies you actually use. You can:
- Remove badges you don't use
- Add new badges from these sources:
  - [shields.io](https://shields.io)
  - [Markdown Badges Collection](https://github.com/Ileriayo/markdown-badges)

### Step 5: Update Social Links

Replace the placeholder URLs in the "Connect With Me" section:

```markdown
[LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/your-username)  ‚Üí  [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/johndoe)
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/your-username)  ‚Üí  [Twitter](https://twitter.com/johndoe)
```

## üéØ Advanced Customization

### Changing Color Themes

All the GitHub stats widgets use the `tokyonight` theme by default. You can change this by replacing `theme=tokyonight` with any of these themes:

- `dark`
- `radical`
- `merko`
- `gruvbox`
- `onedark`
- `cobalt`
- `synthwave`
- `highcontrast`
- `dracula`

Example:
```markdown
theme=tokyonight  ‚Üí  theme=dracula
```

### Customizing the Typing Animation

Edit the typing animation by modifying the URL parameters:

```
lines=Welcome+to+my+GitHub+Profile!+%F0%9F%91%8B;Full+Stack+Developer+%7C+Tech+Enthusiast
```

Each line is separated by a semicolon (`;`). Add or modify lines as needed.

Parameters you can adjust:
- `size=22` - Font size
- `duration=3000` - Time to type each line (milliseconds)
- `pause=1000` - Pause between lines (milliseconds)
- `color=2E9EF7` - Text color (hex without #)

### Updating Pinned Projects

Replace the placeholder project names with your actual repository names:

```markdown
repo=project-1  ‚Üí  repo=awesome-app
repo=project-2  ‚Üí  repo=cool-website
```

If the repository doesn't exist yet, the card will show an error. You can remove these sections or add more pinned project cards.

## üêç Setting Up the Snake Animation

The snake animation is already configured! Here's what happens:

1. **Automatic Generation**: The GitHub Action (`.github/workflows/snake.yml`) runs every 12 hours
2. **Manual Trigger**: You can manually trigger it from the Actions tab
3. **Output Branch**: The animation is saved to an `output` branch

### First-Time Setup

After you push this code to your repository:

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click on "Actions" tab
3. Click on "Generate Snake Animation" workflow
4. Click "Run workflow" button
5. Wait for it to complete (takes about 1 minute)

The snake will now appear in your README!

### Troubleshooting Snake Animation

If the snake doesn't show up:
- Make sure the workflow has run at least once
- Check that the `output` branch was created
- Verify the workflow has write permissions (should be automatic)

## üéµ Optional: Setting Up Spotify Widget

1. Visit [Novatorem](https://github.com/novatorem/novatorem)
2. Follow their setup instructions
3. Deploy to Vercel
4. Update the URL in your README

## ‚è±Ô∏è Optional: Setting Up WakaTime Stats

To show your coding time statistics:

1. Sign up at [WakaTime](https://wakatime.com)
2. Install WakaTime plugin in your code editor
3. Get your WakaTime username
4. Replace `andrewprasetya-k` with your WakaTime username in the stats URL

---

## üìù Optional: Auto-Update Blog Posts

To automatically show your latest blog posts:

1. Create a file `.github/workflows/blog-post-workflow.yml`
2. Use the [blog-post-workflow](https://github.com/gautamkrishnar/blog-post-workflow) action
3. Add your blog RSS feed URL
4. The workflow will automatically update your README with new posts

Example workflow:

```yaml
name: Latest blog post workflow
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 */6 * * *'
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  update-readme-with-blog:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: gautamkrishnar/blog-post-workflow@master
        with:
          feed_list: "https://your-blog.com/feed.xml"
```

## üé® Color Customization Reference

### Header & Footer Banner Colors

The header and footer use `customColorList=6,11,20`. These numbers correspond to:
- 6, 11, 20 = Blue-Purple gradient

You can change these numbers (0-30) to get different color combinations.

### Custom Color Schemes

For consistent theming, here are matching color combinations:

**Dark Blue Theme:**
- Background: `0D1117`
- Title: `58A6FF`
- Text: `C9D1D9`
- Accent: `1F6FEB`

**Purple Theme:**
- Background: `1a1b27`
- Title: `bb9af7`
- Text: `a9b1d6`
- Accent: `7aa2f7`

**Green Theme:**
- Background: `0d1117`
